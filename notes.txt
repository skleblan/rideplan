for requests in chrome, having issue where links need
to be clicked twice have theory that using multiple
threads in starman will fix that (as opposed to just
using the default plack server)

for adding new riders, lynx gives an error about being
unable to resend the same data for reloading the page.
ends up working out fine, but the warning is annoying

for removing new riders, lynx doesn't reload the page
correctly. need to use Ctrl-R

project concept is to develop software that can be used to plan bike ride trips

feature ideas
 - logging in users
 - creating rides
 - inviting riders

what is a ride? what goes in the email invite

hello stacy
you are invited for a ride on <start date>
we plan to do <x> miles w/ <x> stops
it will/willnot be an overnight trip

first, get this running as easiest as possible.
then look at:
 - if possible, would like to try and design collection of REST microservices
 - if possible, rework front-end as react framework?

maybe start by trying to set up oauth2 w/ google ?

data storage tables
user table
ride table 
rider table (parent-child table of rides and users)
ridenotes table??
